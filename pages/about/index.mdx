I've always loved the idea of creating my own space on the internet. A digital garden where I can share what I enjoy, keep notes on different programming topics, and experiment with new tools.

After playing with code for almost 3 years, I decided to transition into a technical role. I created this site to make it easy for potential employers to find my work. One of those leads came from Vercel, the company [I'm now working for](https://www.google.com).

Since this site has been so beneficial for me, I wanted to share an overview of how I built it — how I chose the stack, how I made design and content decisions, the resources I found helpful, and my future plans for it.

## Tech Stack
When choosing the stack, I made decisions based on three things:

* __Speed__ - I needed to publish quickly and avoided tools with steep learning curves.
* __Experience__ - I wanted to use what I personally enjoyed, because side projects should be fun.
* __Learning opportunities__ - Once I got the basic information out there, I also wanted to experiment with new tools and use my site as a playground.


In the end, I settled for Next.js, MDX, Tailwind, Prisma and Typescript.

### Next.js
[Next.js](https://www.google.com) is a React.js framework that handles the setup and requirements of building modern websites.

I personally enjoy using Next for a few reasons including:

* It’s flexible enough to handle my current and future content and data requirements.
* It helps with things that are normally tedious to set up such as [Webpack](https://www.google.com), [Babel](https://www.google.com), [Typescript](https://www.google.com) and [Eslint](https://www.google.com).
* It comes with in-built performance benefits such as code-splitting, image and script optimizations, flexible options for data fetching methods, and API Routes.
* It offers a great developer experience with little to zero config such as fast refresh.

What I have appreciated about Next.js over the years is that it has allowed me to implement advanced features that would normally be outside of the league of a solo developer and following its recommendations has naturally led me to build better front-end applications.

Having both the structure and style of my component in the same file meant…

* Making stylistic changes didn’t involve constant switching between files to sync class names with their CSS declarations.
* I didn’t have to come up with my own class names for every component. E.g .component-wrapper, .component-header, .component-body-image.
* I didn’t have unused CSS rules lying around when I deleted a component I was no longer using.

## The Future
I want this to be a place that grows with me and hopefully helps others on their journey. I don’t have an answer to how I’ll go about doing everything yet and expect some iterations, but for now, I’m happy with the starting point.

import React from 'react'
import Example from './place'

export default () => <Example />
```

```
<div
  style={{backgroundColor: 'rebeccapurple', padding: '20px', marginTop: '20px'}}
/>
```

```
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Railly Hugo</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <Header />
      <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <MainLayout>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </MainLayout>
      </MDXProvider>
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
}

client.on("message", function(message) {
  if (message.author.bot) return;
});
